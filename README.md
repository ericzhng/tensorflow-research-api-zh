# TensorFlow Models Revisited

This repository contains a lot of models implemented using TensorFlow. This is a modified version of the code from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research). The purpose of this is only to provide a smooth experience for first-time users. As when I was using some of the models, I got pretty devastated when I had to face a lot of errors. This is also a good practice for me to get deep understanding of the algorithms behind the scene.

Please be aware that as I am still on my way to become experts on the algorithms, it is not guaranteed that they are correct. But to the best of my knowledge, I will try to make it correct. 


For those who are not familiar with tensorflow API, this is some extension packages from TensorFlow for various applications, so you can take advantage of them for your own research and application purposes.
```
The [research models](https://github.com/ericzhng/tensorflow-research-api-zh/research) are a large collection of models implemented in TensorFlow by researchers. They are not officially supported or available in release branches.

Please contact me directly if there is any issues with regards to infringement of copyright. I did this work only for the purpose of keeping some maintenance of the models for beginners.
